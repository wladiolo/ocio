# ocio

*ocio* is a very simple program that uses nmap functionalities to monitor a range of IPs.

## Scenario

*ocio* wants to help people that need to monitor a range of IPs and want to be alerted if some specific port or services are open.

*ocio* can also report on the status of SSL/TLS.

## How to use ocio 

*ocio* is made of three scripts that perform different operations.

### ocio.sh
It carries out the main functionalities of ocio (find live IPs, scan or open ports, scan SSL/TLS).

```
./ocio.sh [OPTIONS]
 -i <input>: input file with IPs or subnet, one per line (required)
 -m <mode>: mode of execution (required):
 	1 found live IPs only
	2 found live IPs and open ports
	3 found live IPs, open ports and SSL/TLS information
 -pb <list>: comma separated list of black listed ports. Use "none" to match every port - no blacklist (required)
 -sb <list>: comma separated list of black listed services. Use "none" to match every service - no blacklist (required)
  Please note that -pb and -sb are in AND
 	-pb n1,n2 -sb s1,s2 match n1 AND s1, n1 AND s2, n2 AND s1, n2 AND s2
	-pb none -sb s1,s2 match s1 or s2 AND every possible open port
	-pb n1,n2 -sb none match n1 or n2 AND every possible open service
   -pb none -sb none match all
 -s <email>: send summary to the specified email address (optional)
 -h print this help (optional)
```

#### How to use Port Blacklist (-pb)

Port blacklist lets you list the ports that, if found open, will trigger an alert.
Port number will be exactly matched, so for example if you specify:

```
-pb 80
```
*ocio* will alert you if port 80 is open, but not if port 8080 is open.

If you put *none* every open port will be notified (it means no blacklist).

#### How to use Service Blacklist (-sb)

Service blacklist lets you list the services that, if found open, will trigger an alert.
Service will be searched in the service name, so for example if you specify:

```
-sb http
```
*ocio* will alert if service http, https, http-proxy, ... is on an open port.

If you put *none* every service will be notified (it means no blacklist)

### ocio_open_port_analysis.sh
It search in the scan results the open port and services you specified in -pb and -sb options.
You can use this script with every .nmap output file (also if is not generated by ocio.sh).

```
 ./ocio_open_port_analysis.sh [OPTIONS]
 -i <file>: nmap results of a port scan in .nmap format (required)
 -pb <list>: comma separated list of black listed ports. Use "none" to match every port - no blacklist (required)
 -sb <list>: comma separated list of black listed services. Use "none" to match every service - no blacklist (required)
  Please note that -pb and -sb are in AND
 	-pb n1,n2 -sb s1,s2 match n1 AND s1, n1 AND s2, n2 AND s1, n2 AND s2
	-pb none -sb s1,s2 match s1 or s2 AND every possible open port
	-pb n1,n2 -sb none match n1 or n2 AND every possible open service
   -pb none -sb none match all
 -o <dir>: output directory (optional)
 -h print this help (optional)
```

### ocio_tls_discovery_analysis.sh

(WIP)

```
 ./ocio_open_port_analysis.sh [OPTIONS]
 -i <file>: nmap results of a port scan in .nmap format (required)
 -o <dir>: output directory (optional)
 -h print this help (optional)
```
